              This area is for Owners -- i.e. those who own a TrunkNFT (eventually we want to build a token-gate)
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
              Owners can check the financial performance of Branch sales (volume and revenue) in real time.
              <br></br>
              And can claim their share of the cash flow in real time as well.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              The process works as such:
              <br></br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;1/ view total ETH balance from BranchNFT sales in the BranchNFT contract;
              <br></br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;2/ release ETH in BranchNFT contract to the Payments contract;
              <br></br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;3/ release ETH payable to Owner from Payments contract to the Owner's wallet. 
              <br></br>
              <b>The functions in this process can only be executed by Owners.</b>
              <br></br>
